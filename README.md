## During the piscine
Congrats ! You have been selected to participate to this experience. In that section, I'll share with you a list of advice and practice that could help you and make your time a little bit easier.
### General Tips
 - **Respect the norm !** 

 - Make sure to verify and **re-verify** what you are commiting for correction. It can be time consuming but at the end, you will save you way more time than what you can expect.

 - Try to book your corrections in a single block. It will avoid you to run everywhere and to stay focused while you are working (Prefer 45min of corrections than being interuppted every 15min because you will have to re-focus you multiple times on what you were doing).
 
 - Do not be affraid to take a break and leave/go to sleep if you feel the need to. You will be inefficient and loose your time anyway.
 
 - Be focus while you are making corrections. This is where you can learn the most from people that are ahead of you in the exercises.
 
 - Write tests in exams, and **do not forgot to erase them** before your commit.
 ### Set up
 I'm currently using [Sublim Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) as text editor. It's an easy to use editor and you can highly modify it depending on your settings and packages installed  

Note : during exams, you will have to use Vim. You should be comfortable enough with it, Vim is a really complete tool but you can easily struggle with it at the beginning. That's why I advise you to use Sublim in parralel of Vim during the Piscine.
