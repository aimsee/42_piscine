# 42's Piscine training
In this repository, you'll find a bunch of content to be well prepared to 42's piscine. Including the subjects, functional tests for your code and useful links that helped me to prepare myself.
## Subjects
 Find all the exercises that you will encounter during the Piscine. It also includes the BSQ, Rush and Shell exercises.

## Tests
:package: WIP

If you want to test your functions just simply add the files to the folder with your files and compile them together. It will allow you to compare your code with the built-in libraries functions and your programs

## During the piscine
Congrats ! You have been selected to participate to this experience. In that section, I'll share with you a list of advice and practice that could help you and make your time a little bit easier.
### General Tips
 - **Respect the norm !**

 - Make sure to verify and **re-verify** what you are commiting for correction. It can be time consuming but at the end, you will save you way more time than what you can expect.

 - Try to book your corrections in a single block. It will avoid you to run everywhere and to stay focused while you are working (Prefer 45min of corrections than being interuppted every 15min because you will have to re-focus you multiple times on what you were doing).

 - Do not be affraid to take a break and leave/go to sleep if you feel the need to. You will be inefficient and loose your time anyway.

 - Be focus while you are making corrections. This is where you can learn the most from people that are ahead of you in the exercises.

 - Write tests in exams, and **do not forgot to erase them** before your commit.
 ### Set up

 I'm currently using [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) as text editor. It's an easy to use editor and you can highly modify it depending on your settings and packages installed.

 - To add the required 42's header in files, I invite you to copy [this repository](https://github.com/kigiri/sublime-header-42) to your Sublime packages to access it via Sublim go to : ***Preferences*** and then ***Browse Package***. You will just have to press `ctrl + shift + h` to add the header to your file.

 - Vim and Sublime Text can be deeply modified to fit your style. To begin with, I advise you to add this following line of code to your vim configuration file :

 `set mouse=a` : you will be able to use your mouse to in vim

 `set nu` : it displays line number while you are editing (it helps a lot when you are running the norm and to see where is your mistake
 )
 `:syntax on` it highlights the code you are writting.

 To access to your vim configuration file, type `vim .vimrc`

I let you do your own researches to find new possibilities to customize it.

Note : during exams, you will have to use Vim. You should be comfortable enough with it, Vim is a really complete tool but you can easily struggle with it at the beginning. That's why I advise you to use Sublime in parralel of Vim during the Piscine.
